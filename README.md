# DiabHack

This is a program I wrote for Diablo 1 which allowed code to be injected into the Diablo process without needing to run the `.exe` from the hacker.  At the time of initial release there were tons of hacks which were delivered in `.exe` form and I, for one, was worried about running untrusted programs on my system.  My thinking was that once someone was happy to trust `diabhack.exe` then they didn't have to trust any other `.exe` file.

Instead of running the hack's `.exe` file to initiate the hack, the hack could be distributed in text form (`.hak` files).  The user was also able to remove the hack if they wanted and combine them.

I released the code a while back but no online copy of the source tree exists to my knowledge, so I have released the source once again for posterity.
